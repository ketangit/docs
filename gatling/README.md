Create a spring-boot version 3.5.1 application using jaav21 for Gatling Runner & Viewer
- The application provides:
    - Spring Boot does not compile, load, or run Gatling classes
    - Gatling scenario execution from UI (htmx) via external process (gatling.sh)
    - Scenario definitions loaded from Kubernetes ConfigMap
    - Results are written to S3
    - Live execution output via htmx polling
    - S3-backed Gatling HTML report viewer
    - All Gatling Simulations are packaged with the Gatling distribution or mounted volume
    - Kubernetes-ready deployment
- no Thymeleaf dependency
- no Gatling dependencies in pom.xml
- use pure HTMX + server-rendered HTML fragments only. Spring MVC returns plain HTML strings/fragments, not template views.
- Dynamic HTML fragments returned directly from controllers
- htmx handles, Scenario loading, Form submission, Polling for execution output
- Gatling is heavy, uses Scala, and pulls many transitive dependencies. Keeping it outside the web JVM
- A multi-stage Dockerfile (Spring Boot + Gatling)
- A worker-pod execution model
- Scenarios loaded from ConfigMap (mounted read-only)
- IAM roles for S3 access should be provided to worker pods (IRSA or node role) — web app only needs presign capability if required
- HTMX handles incremental updates: form posts, polling, and fragment swaps.
- Use Kubernetes Jobs/CronJobs to spawn workers; ensure pod lifecycle, resource limits, node selectors, and tolerations are set.
- No need for Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart, CI/CD pipelines, IAM role details
- Generate the full project skeleton (Maven layout, complete Java classes, Dockerfile, and README) ready to build and deploy to EKS
